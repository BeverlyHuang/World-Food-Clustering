# World Food Clustering

By Beverly Huang

### Goal
People nowadays care more about food and health. Especially for exercisers, they will choose food with low fat and low sugar. This project aims to cluster food based on food composition and provide recommendations for people looking for a specific type of food.

### Conclusion
In the era of health life style, the project aims to provide recommendations for people looking for a specific type of food. KMeans Clustering algorithm is used for clustering. Yellowbrick Visualizer Elbow Method and Silhouette Visualizer are used to determining the appropriate number of clusters. PCA is used to restructure six features into three variables, which also improves clustering performance. From this model, we can recommend foods in the purple cluster to exercisers, because foods in this cluster have low fat, low carbohydrate and low sugar.
